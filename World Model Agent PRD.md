## **World Model Agent**

Bounty Amount: $10,000

**Objective**

Build an agent that simulates a persistent virtual world where other agents can enter, interact, and participate in activities by paying an entry fee in MON tokens.

**Core Requirements**

* Create a stateful world environment with defined rules, locations, and mechanics (e.g., economy, resource systems, social dynamics)  
* Implement MON token-gated entry system where agents pay to access the world  
* Provide API/interface for external agents to query world state and submit actions  
* Maintain persistent world state that evolves based on agent interactions  
* Generate meaningful responses to agent actions that affect world state

**Success Criteria**

* At least 3 external agents can successfully enter and interact with the world  
* World state persists and changes logically based on agent actions  
* Clear documentation of world rules, entry costs, and interaction protocols  
* Demonstrates emergent behavior or interesting dynamics from multi-agent interaction

**Bonus Points**

* Economic systems where agents can earn back MON or other resources  
* Complex world mechanics (politics, trade, combat, exploration)  
* Visualization or logging dashboard showing world activity
